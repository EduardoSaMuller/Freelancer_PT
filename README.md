### Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://hedr0n@bitbucket.org/hedr0n/gracaminnaruben.git projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
